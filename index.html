    <center><h1> The Start-Up Circle</h1></center>
    <center><h3> The Startup Circle is a group of entrepreneurs and others involved or interested in the Atlanta startup community. It is held at Tech Alpharetta and has been meeting weekly for over ten years (with changing members over time). It is a hybrid meeting, meeting at Tech Alpharetta and by Zoom. It is from 9-10:30 am each Friday. <br> <br>The agenda is very unstructured. We have a round of brief introductions, so everyone knows who is “in the room.” We usually have a more in depth conversation about one of the businesses. Someone may have specific questions they would like to address (such as managing offshore tech teams, or entering a new market or just to get feedback on a concept) that they announce during their introduction. We typically have time to do 2-3 companies/topics. This is a general conversation of about 30 minutes then move on to a different topic. Entrepreneurs gain a lot from the discussion. They walk away with some things to think about that they may not be aware of. We sometimes have someone do a PowerPoint deck, but usually not...just a conversation.</h3></center>
